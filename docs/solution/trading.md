# Trading 

## Why trading?

Having the ability to trade on-chain has been the priority for multiple users. Looking at the data we can see that 5M/USD is being earned by roughly RailGun(one of the providers of Private swap).

On-chain trades are fully transparent, making transaction details publicly visible.

Traders using specific strategies can easily be copied, front-run (exploited), or reverse-engineered. This lack of confidentiality undermines their competitive edge.

Information asymmetry is a core feature of financial systems, allowing participants to gain rewards based on unique insights or strategies. Publicly visible trades erode this necessary asymmetry.

Instead of leveling the playing field, we are seeing cabals or closed Telegram groups exploit access to private "alpha" (trade secrets). This dynamic resembles insider trading in traditional finance, creating unfair advantages for select groups.

By enabling privacy for on-chain strategies, we can restore fair competition. Traders and users can be paid or incentivized based on their proprietary strategies while keeping their competitive edge intact.
