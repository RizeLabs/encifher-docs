## Why Trading?

Trading on-chain has always been a top priority for users, but it comes with one big problem: **everything is public.**

Take RailGun, for example—a provider of private swaps. Their users collectively earn around **$5M USD**, proving the demand for privacy in trading. But the broader market still struggles with transparency issues that harm traders in multiple ways:

1. **Public Trades Mean Public Secrets**:
   - Every trade is an open book, exposing transaction details for anyone to see.
   - Result? Traders lose their competitive edge as strategies can be **copied**, **front-run**, or **reverse-engineered**.

2. **Information Asymmetry Matters**:
   - Financial systems thrive on **information asymmetry**, where unique insights or strategies are rewarded.
   - Publicly visible trades destroy this edge, leveling the playing field in the wrong way.

3. **Private Groups Exploit "Alpha"**:
   - Instead of open competition, **closed Telegram groups** and cabals are exploiting private trade secrets.
   - This creates an uneven dynamic, resembling **insider trading** in traditional finance.

### **The Solution**
By enabling **privacy for on-chain strategies**, we can restore fairness. Traders can execute their unique strategies without fear of being exploited, incentivizing them to participate openly while keeping their competitive edge intact.

## Who is the User?

Let’s break it down—there are two main personas who benefit from private trading:

### **1. Degen Traders**
- These are the pros, the high-risk, high-reward players of the crypto world.
- They need to move funds between addresses **without creating obvious linkages** that could expose their strategies.

### **2. Daily Taskers**
- These are everyday users who value privacy in their financial lives.
- For example, they don’t want to share their address with a sender, as it could reveal their **entire balance sheet**.
