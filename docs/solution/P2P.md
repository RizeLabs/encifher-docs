Stablecoin payments are the backbone of crypto adoption and the biggest **Product-Market Fit (PMF)** in the industry. In **2024**, the stablecoin market reached a staggering **$200B** and is projected to **double by 2025**.

For merchants to fully adopt stablecoin payments in their day-to-day operations, **privacy on public blockchains** is a necessity. Here's why:

1. **Trust in Leading Chains**: 
   - Merchants trust chains like **Ethereum**, **Base**, and **Solana** for their **SAFE wallets** and robust infrastructure.

2. **Privacy for Financial Peace**:
   - Merchants need **privacy in their balance sheets**, ensuring their sensitive financial data is shielded while maintaining operational transparency.
