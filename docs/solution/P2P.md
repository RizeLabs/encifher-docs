# P2P Payments

## Why payments?
Stable coin payments are the biggest form of crypto PMF. In 2024 we have seen the stable coin markets reached ~200B and is supposed to double in 2025.

For merchants across the world to adopt the stable coin payments in their day to day life is something we need privacy in public blockchains. This provides two things:

1. Trust of chains like Ethereum, Base, Solana etc. for having their SAFE Wallets
2. Privacy in their balancesheets which provides them the peace that they are habitual to.
