# What is Privacy2.0?

Privacy 2.0 can be assumed because of the possibility of having "Private Shared State". This means that we can have two states in public and private which can co-exist and interact with each other.

Earlier these states was not possible and computation between the public states which are on-chain. Now to have that interaction, zk circuits are used and then the SNARK proof is used to update the global public state. 

With Privacy2 2.0 solutions, we get the different states from different users(or addresses) interacting with each other. This happens beacuse in the backed we use Privacy Enhancing Technologies(PET) which enable homomorphic operations to be performed. These PETs consist of Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE), Multi-Party Computation(MPC), and Trusted Execution Environments(TEEs).

Homomorphic property implies that any message M1 when encrypted produces a ciphertext C1 when operated with other ciphertext C2 produces a resulted which when decrypted produces the same result when M1 & M2 are operated.
