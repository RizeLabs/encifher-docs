# Why is on-chain privacy required?

Blockchain and DeFi systems champion transparency and decentralization, but this openness comes at a costâ€”user transaction data is exposed to the public.

This lack of privacy introduces significant risks:

- **Deterrence for Privacy-Conscious Users:** Users who value confidentiality may avoid engaging with blockchain ecosystems entirely.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Public visibility of transactions opens doors to exploits such as front-running attacks and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) manipulation.
- **Physical Threats:** In extreme cases, users face risks like *"five-dollar wrench attacks,"* where individuals are physically coerced to reveal their private keys.

### The Overlooked Pillar of Open Source

Privacy is a cornerstone of the open-source ethos, yet it is often sidelined in the design of dApps. While billions of dollars are locked in ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin, privacy solutions are notably absent from their near-term roadmaps. 

This leaves users with limited options to safeguard their sensitive data, exposing them to unnecessary risks and creating barriers to widespread adoption.

### The Need for a Paradigm Shift

Encifher addresses these challenges by embedding privacy into the core of DeFi applications, ensuring user safety without compromising on transparency, performance, or compliance.
