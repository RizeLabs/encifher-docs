# Why is on-chain privacy required?

Blockchain and DeFi systems promote transparency and decentralization but expose user transaction data to the public.

This visibility poses significant privacy risks, deterring privacy-conscious users and opening the door to security threats like front-running attacks.

Privacy is a fundamental pillar of the open-source ecosystem, yet it is often overlooked in DApps. 

With billions of USD locked in ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin, privacy solutions are not even a part of their near-term roadmap. This leaves users with no choice but to engage with these systems without privacy, exposing sensitive financial data.
