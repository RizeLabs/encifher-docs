# Who Can Integrate?

Encifher is designed to integrate seamlessly with a variety of systems, enabling privacy as a service for both **existing** and **new protocols.** Here's who we envision as ideal customers:

---

### **1. Existing Protocols**
Encifher can enhance privacy for established platforms with significant activity. This includes:

- **DeFi Protocols**:
  - Ideal for protocols with substantial order flow or actions involving assets flowing in and out, such as swaps, lending, or staking.
  - Example: A DEX integrating Encifher for private swaps to protect user trading strategies.

- **Wallet Providers**:
  - Wallets can integrate Encifher’s **SWAP module** to enable **private payments** for their users.
  - Example: A wallet offering privacy-first peer-to-peer payments for small transactions.

---

### **2. New Protocols**
Emerging protocols can easily incorporate Encifher’s privacy features by:

- **Integrating the Encifher Solidity Library**:
  - This library provides modular, plug-and-play privacy solutions for new dApps.
  - Example: A new lending protocol offering private collateralization options powered by Encifher.
